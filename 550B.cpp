// Should i use 1 or 1ULL?
// For this problem, since nâ‰¤15, the maximum number of problems is small, so even
// when you shift the bit 15 places (i.e., 1 << 15), a 32-bit integer is sufficient.
// You can safely use 1. If you want to future-proof your code for larger inputs, or
// make sure it handles larger shifts, you can use 1ULL, but it's not necessary here.

// Bitmasking is specifically for generating subsequences, not subarrays, because it allows you to selectively include or exclude any element from the array while preserving the order.
